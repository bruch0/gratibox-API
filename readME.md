### How the persistent login works

```bash
# Every private route requests the JWT given to you at some point
# Thats because only logged users should be able to make those requests on the database
# Every JWT is valid for 15 minutes, after that, every private route you access would return 401 (unauthorized)
# To avoid user frustration, when the JWT is expired, every route also checks if the token is exactly the last one registered in the database
# If it is, the access is granted one more time, and a new token is given to the user
# That why every private route can give you a newToken
```
